Perfect, let's start with a detailed implementation plan. I'll help you set up the Firebase Functions and create a robust system.

First, let's set up Firebase Functions:

bashCopy# Install Firebase CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase Functions in your project directory
firebase init functions
When prompted:

Choose TypeScript
Select "Yes" for ESLint
Select "Yes" for dependencies installation


Let's create our initial function structure. I'll create an artifact with the basic setup:

Now, let's update your location card component to show the timestamps. Here's how we can modify it:

Here's the step-by-step implementation plan:

Setup Phase

Run the Firebase initialization commands above
Deploy the initial function to verify setup:
bashCopyfirebase deploy --only functions

Check Firebase Console to verify the function is deployed
Monitor logs to ensure it's running every 5 minutes


Testing Phase

Create a test location in Firestore manually
Verify the function is updating the lastChecked timestamp
Check the logs in Firebase Console


Next Steps (once the basic setup is confirmed working):

Implement the actual appointment checking logic
Add error handling and retries
Implement notification system
Add more sophisticated status tracking



Would you like me to:

Show you how to test the function locally?
Proceed with implementing the appointment checking logic?
Help with setting up the Firestore structure?

Also, do you need help modifying your existing location service to work with this new consolidated structure?RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.
