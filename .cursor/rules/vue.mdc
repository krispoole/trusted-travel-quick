# Vue.js Specific Rules

- Use Single File Components (SFC)
- Name components using PascalCase
- Use props for component communication
- Implement proper prop validation
- Use computed properties for derived data
- Emit events for child-to-parent communication
- Use v-for with :key for list rendering
- Avoid v-if with v-for on the same element
