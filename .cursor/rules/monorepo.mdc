# Monorepo Development Rules

## Project Structure
```
├── frontend/          # Next.js application
├── functions/         # Firebase Functions
├── shared/           # Shared types and utilities
└── package.json     # Root workspace
```

## Workspace Configuration
```json
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "frontend",
    "functions",
    "shared"
  ]
}
```

## Development Practices

### Package Management
- Use workspace-aware package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm)
- Maintain consistent versions across packages
- Share dependencies through workspace root
- Use strict versioning for shared packages

### Type Sharing
```typescript
// shared/types/index.ts
export interface SharedTypes {
  // Common types used across packages
}
```

### Build Process
- Coordinate builds between packages
- Handle dependencies correctly
- Use proper build caching

### Testing
- Run tests across all affected packages
- Use shared test utilities
- Maintain consistent test coverage requirements

### CI/CD
- Build and test all packages
- Deploy in correct order
- Handle package interdependencies
